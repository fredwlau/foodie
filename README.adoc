SPRING REST FOODIE SERVICE

This program is a RESTful webservice that uses the Geocodio and Zomato APIs to take an address and present a list of restaurants in the nearby vicinity.  To achieve this we use Spring Rest and Spring Boot frameworks.

Geocodio takes an address and returns the latitude and longitude of the address

The latitude and longitude are then sent through the Zomato API to retrieve a list of restaurants that we present to the user

All return objects come as JSON

To run:

Run in eclipse, localhost:8080
